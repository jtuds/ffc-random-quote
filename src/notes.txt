Work out a way to return a default object from the function when the API promise is rejected and how to test said default object


I need to say if API promise is rejected then this function returns this default object else it returns the data from the API - NEED TO KNOW WHAT A FAILED API CALL LOOKS LIKE

Why is it saying my promise rejection is unhandled?
