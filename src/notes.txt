Need to mock out the fetch function so that I'm not actually testing the quote API.

I need to pass fetch into the quote function and when calling the getRandomQuote in the test the fetch that gets passed wll be a fake one that just returns some dummy data. I can then assert that the correct shape gets returned aswell as the actual values

MPJ said that if your fake fetch works aswell as your real fetch in the sandbox then it should be good to go. I guess that's a tad brittle though because your code never actually tests the API for real but that goes back to not testing the API anyway
